README


Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

The Climate data will consist of Precipitation Analysis and Station Analysis.

Design Your Climate App

Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed. 

(I was having trouble getting the 2nd part done due to some of the solutions from the module being handed to us a little later)
